# CSci 574: Final Class Project

## Project Description


Data Set Name: Name of Dataset
Data Source url: http://domain.com/dataset

Your description and project plans goes here.


## Instructions for Getting Started and Choosing a DataSet to Analyze

Please choose a dataset and descirbe in general what are the features of the data you will be working with and you plans for
analysis and modeling of the data.  I won't hold  you strictly to your plans here, as you thought may change as you explore the
data.  But you should give me a paragraph or two description of your understanding of the data features and your thoughts
on what you will do with the data.

You can use a dataset of your own, though check with me directly to make sure it is ok.  If the data source does not have
an easily accessable url you can point to, you will need to put the data into the `data` subdirectory and/or create scripts
to download and obtain a copy of the data so that I can see it.  It is a requirement that I am able to look at the data you
will use for your project, and run your code on it, so you will need to pick something that you can publically share.  I will
probably only allow one person each semester to claim and work on a particular dataset from a public source, so it will be first-come-first
serve and if you have a preference or something in mind you might want to finish your description here and commit early to get
first dibs.  Some public data libraries that you can look at for datasets to use include:

- [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Top Sources for Machine Learning Datasets](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-sources-for-machine-learning-datasets-bb6d0dc3378b) this is an article with some additional
  data set repositories you can consider.
  
You cannot use datasets other students are using this semester.  Also you cannot use common popular datasets, especially ones that we
have looked at (or will look at) in our class.  So most of the datasets I see on the UCI Popular datasets I will not let you use
this semester, which include the Iris, Heart Disease, Wine Quality, Adult income and Breast Cancer Wisconsin datasets, which are too well known
to make good projects.

Please select a dataset by the due date.  Update this Readme with the url source of the dataset.  If you are not using a dataset with a easily accessible url, please put the data into
the `data` subdirectory, and/or put in scripts to download the datasource into the `data` subdirectory.  Then write a paragraph or more describing the features of the dataset
and your understanding of what the dataset includes before you have done any detailed exploration.  Describe hat labels
you think you will be using as a target of your models.  You should plan to perform a supervisied learning task for your project.


## Project Structure

In general the directory structure for this project/class repository follows
suggestions and best practices for create data science projects.
See for example
[Cookie Cutter data science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)
and [Python data science projects](https://gist.github.com/ericmjl/27e50331f24db3e8f957d1fe7bbbe510)

Here is the overview of the class repository structure:

**data/**

All data files used for assignments and used in the lecture notebooks
go here.  Some data files are local to the repository, but for larger data
files, scripts may be used to download a larger data file to this
repository data directory for local use.

**docs**/

Additional documentation for the class.  Class syllabus, and possible
assingment descriptions, slides and handouts will be placed here.

**figures**/

All static image files used in documents and notebooks. Images may
be generated by code and saved as part of a notebook or workflow, or
may be static images captured for use in documentation.

**lectures**/

Jupyter/iPython notebooks used for course lectures, video lectures and in
general the main resource with the course textbook and assignments for  
learning the course concepts.

**scripts**/

Separate executable scripts used to set up project aspects, load data for
the project, etc.  Bootstrap scripts are used by the Vagrant box
provisioning process to set up the virtual vagrant box for use by the
project.

**src**/

Project package(s) for this class.  Functions and classes that are of
general use in more than one notebook are pulled out as functions
(into the `custom_funcs.py` file), or separate functions and classes.
The `ml_python_class` module can be installed in the normal Python way on the system using
the `setup.py` file if needed, or it can be dynamically added to the
python path using for example:

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('../src')

from ml_python_class.custom_funcs import version_information
version_information()
```

**README.md, LICENSE**

Top level markdown files holding general project information.  
README.md markdown files may also be given in subdirectories for
further information about aspects of the project.

**Vagrantfile**

A standard vagrant init file.  Contains the configuration and
specifications to download and provision a vagrant box running
Anaconda Python3 and a JupyterHub/JupyterLab server.
